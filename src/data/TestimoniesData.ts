      "One of my favorite parts about being a part of the ULA program was watching the growth of students over the years. I watched them not only become better problem solvers but also gain confidence in their skills, support other students and even some becoming ULAs themselves! It makes me glad that I was part of such an amazing community.",

      "In my three years with ULA, the ULA tutors have been some of the most helpful people I've met. They've helped me grow into a better, more confident coder, and I truly couldn't have passed 10C without them. Also, ULA isn't just a place for learning but it's a commuinity where you meet people who share your interests and understand your struggles with CS. Some of the tutors I've met eventually became close friends, and I wouldn't have met them if it weren't for this program.",
